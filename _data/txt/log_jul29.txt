MANAGER ON DUTY: Tony Pepperoni

--- OPENING NOTES (10:00 AM) ---
All staff present and on time. Brenda, Gary, Maria all here.
Received produce order from Valley Farms. Everything looks fresh, but the basil container seems a bit light. Weighed it, came in at 4.5kg instead of the usual 5kg. Sent a note to Maria Garcia.
The freezer in the back is making that weird humming noise again. It's holding temperature for now, but we need to get it looked at. Submitted a maintenance ticket (TICKET #IT-725).

--- MID-SHIFT (4:00 PM) ---
Prepped extra dough for the evening rush. We ran out last Tuesday, not making that mistake again.
Gary reported a spill in the main dining area. Cleaned up promptly, no issues.
We're running low on 'Volcano Pizza' promotional flyers. Need to request more from marketing. Brenda mentioned customers are asking about it a lot.

--- CLOSING NOTES (11:30 PM) ---
A very busy night. Total sales look strong.
Frank and Jane from the Uptown store called to borrow a box of gluten-free crusts, said they would return them tomorrow. I approved it.
Customer at table 7 complained his Classic Pepperoni was undercooked. I inspected it, and he was right. Apologized and had the kitchen remake it immediately. Gave him a coupon for a free dessert. Customer left happy.
All cleaning tasks completed. Cash drawer balanced perfectly. A good, solid day.
