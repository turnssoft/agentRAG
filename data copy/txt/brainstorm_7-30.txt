Meeting: Q4 Holiday Campaign Brainstorm
Date: 2025-07-30
Attendees: Brenda, Gary

--- GOAL: Create a memorable holiday special. ---

IDEAS:

"The Santa Slice" - Pizza shaped like a Santa hat? Maybe too complicated for the kitchen.

"Jingle Bell Knots" - Our garlic knots, but with a festive dipping sauce. Maybe a cranberry-rosemary marinara? Or a creamy parmesan-sage dip.

"The Winter Warmer" - A pizza with hearty, wintery toppings. Smoked gouda, caramelized onions, maybe some prosciutto or bacon. Sounds cozy.

"12 Days of Pizza" - A different deal every day for the 12 days leading up to Christmas. Could be complex to manage but great for daily engagement.

Day 1: Free soda

Day 2: 10% off

Day 3: Free garlic knots

...etc.

SLOGANS / TAGLINES:

Pizza Boys: Your Holiday Helper.

The Flavor of the Holidays, One Slice at a Time.

Get Toasty with a Pizza Boys Pizza.

Let it Dough, Let it Dough, Let it Dough! (Gary's idea, a bit cheesy but maybe it works?)

PROMOTIONAL CHANNELS:

Instagram photo contest: "Show us your Pizza Boys holiday party." Prize for the best photo.

Email blast with a special coupon for pre-ordering for holiday parties.

Local radio ad spot? Could be expensive. Focus on digital first.

ACTION ITEMS:

Brenda: Flesh out the "Winter Warmer" pizza recipe and cost it out.

Gary: Draft a social media calendar for the "12 Days of Pizza" idea.

Follow-up meeting next week.
