## üçï Our Philosophy: The Pizza Boys Way

At Pizza Boys, we believe in three things:

1. **Quality Ingredients**: We never compromise. From our locally-milled flour to our vine-ripened tomatoes, every ingredient is selected for its freshness and flavor.
2. **Craftsmanship**: Pizza making is an art. We empower our team with the techniques and time needed to create a masterpiece every single time.
3. **Community**: We are more than a pizzeria; we are a neighborhood hub. Every customer should feel like a guest in our home.

## üìñ Standard Pizza Recipes

Consistency is key. All pizzas must be made to these exact specifications. All measurements are for a standard 12-inch pizza.

### The Classic Pepperoni

Our best-seller. A simple, yet perfect pizza.

* **Dough**: 1x 250g Pizza Boys standard dough ball.
* **Sauce**: 4oz (1/2 cup) of Pizza Boys classic tomato sauce.
* **Cheese**: 6oz of shredded, low-moisture mozzarella.
* **Toppings**: 3oz (approx. 24 slices) of high-quality, cup-and-char pepperoni.

**Instructions:**

1. Hand-stretch dough to a 12-inch circle, leaving a 1-inch crust.
2. Spread tomato sauce evenly, leaving a 1/2-inch border from the edge.
3. Distribute mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.
4. Arrange pepperoni slices to ensure full coverage.
5. Bake at 500¬∞F (260¬∞C) for 7-9 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the pepperoni is crispy.

### Veggie Supreme

A garden-fresh favorite for our vegetarian customers.

* **Dough**: 1x 250g Pizza Boys standard dough ball.
* **Sauce**: 4oz (1/2 cup) of Pizza Boys classic tomato sauce.
* **Cheese**: 6oz of shredded, low-moisture mozzarella.
* **Toppings**:

  * 1oz sliced red onions
  * 2oz sliced mushrooms
  * 1oz black olives

**Instructions:**

1. Hand-stretch dough to a 12-inch circle.
2. Spread sauce and cheese as per standard procedure.
3. Evenly distribute all vegetable toppings across the pizza.
4. Bake at 500¬∞F (260¬∞C) for 8-10 minutes. The vegetables should be tender but still have a slight crunch.

## üìû Customer Service Protocols

Our service must be as good as our pizza.

### Handling Phone Orders

* **Greeting**: Always answer with, "Thank you for calling Pizza Boys, this is [Your Name]. How can I help you?"
* **Accuracy**: Repeat the full order back to the customer before finalizing. Include the total price and the estimated time for pickup or delivery.
* **Specials**: Always inform the customer of the current "Daily Special" if they have not already ordered it.

### Resolving Customer Complaints

The L.A.S.T. method is our standard procedure for handling complaints.

* **Listen**: Let the customer explain their issue without interruption.
* **Apologize**: Offer a sincere apology, such as "I'm very sorry to hear that your experience didn't meet our standards."
* **Solve**: Offer a clear and immediate solution. For a cold pizza, offer a replacement or a credit for a future order. For a wrong order, remake it immediately.
* **Thank**: Thank the customer for bringing the issue to your attention.

## üî• Health & Safety Guidelines

Safety is everyone's responsibility.

### Dough Preparation

* Always wash hands thoroughly before handling dough.
* Ensure all surfaces and mixers are sanitized at the beginning and end of each shift.
* Use separate utensils for gluten-free dough to prevent cross-contamination.

### Oven Safety

* Never reach into the oven without proper heat-resistant gloves.
* Keep the area in front of the oven clear of obstructions.
* The oven door should be closed at all times unless actively loading or unloading pizzas.
