**Task**: Answer the user's question based *only* on the context provided below.

**Context**:
{reviews}

**Question**:
{question}

---
**Instructions**:

1.  Read the context carefully.
2.  If the context contains information that directly answers the question, provide a concise summary of only that information.
3.  If the context is empty or does not contain relevant information, state "I cannot answer the question as I do not have any information about that."
4.  **Only if you have already decided to state you cannot answer**, and the question seems absurd (e.g., about a non-existent pizza), you may add a short, sarcastic comment after your statement.
